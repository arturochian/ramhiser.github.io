It has been just a few weeks since [my wife, my son, and I](http://ramhiserfamily.wordpress.com/) moved to Seattle so that I could begin my postdoc at [The Hutch](http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html). Now that we have been here a short time and are settled, we intend to start exploring Seattle, doing typical touristy things as well as non-touristy activities that only Seattlites would do. My wife purchased a detailed guide to Seattle that lists numerous activities, restaurants, scenery, etc. that would take months (years?) to complete. I prefer word of mouth though, so I asked some coworkers for recommendations. Here's what they gave me:

* [The Space Needle](http://www.spaceneedle.com/)
* [Pike Place Market](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/)
* [Ride The Slut](http://ridetheslut.com/)
* [Chandler's Crabhouse](http://www.chandlerscrabhouse.com/)
* [Seattle Art Museum](http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/)
* [Discovery Park](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/discovery.htm)
* Walk around the [Ballard neighborhood](http://www.myballard.com/) -- in particular, the Northwest Market.
* [The Arboretum](http://depts.washington.edu/uwbg/gardens/wpa.shtml) near [UW](http://www.washington.edu/)
* Take a ferry to [Bainbridge Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington)
* The new [ferris wheel](http://seattlegreatwheel.com/) in downtown Seattle
* [Latona Pub](http://www.3pubs.com/Latona.html)

My coworkers recommended parking at [The Hutch](http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html) and riding [The Slut](http://ridetheslut.com/) to [Westlake Center](http://www.westlakecenter.com/) and then walking to [Pike Place](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/) -- avoids traffic. Also, they recommended thta we combine [Discovery Park](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/discovery.htm) and Ballard into one day. They said the view of Seattle from the ferry when returning from [Bainbridge Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington) is breathtaking.

My wife and I like to hike, so I also asked my coworkers for recommendations. Overwhelmingly, they said these two places:

* [Snow Lake](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lake-1/)
* [Middle Fork](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/seasonal-hikes/hikes-of-the-week/middle-fork-snoqualmie-river)

Any other recommendations? In particular, are there any restaurants that you'd recommend?
