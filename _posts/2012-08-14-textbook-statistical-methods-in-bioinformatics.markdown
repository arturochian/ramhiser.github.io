As part of my effort to acquaint myself more with biology, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics, I am trying to find as many resources as I can that provide a solid foundation. For instance, I am wading through [Molecular Biology of the Cell](http://amzn.to/Mx5jCm) at a pace of about 10-15 pages per day -- this takes nearly an hour every day.

I am also going through [Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics by Ewens and Grant](http://amzn.to/PiXCiU) and working selected problems for each chapter. My intention is to post my solutions to these chapter exercises. Thus far, I have made it through the first three chapters, and I will begin posting my solutions soon. I am interested particularly in problems regarding statistical topics with which I have little-to-no experience and also topics where I lack intuition regarding the biological applications.

Here is a thumbnail of the book:
