    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Occasionally, I will query Google with “statistics conferences”, “machine learning conferences” or “pattern recognition conferences” and the like. But often, it is difficult to obtain anything
meaningful other than the conferences of which I'm already aware (such as JSM, ICML, some IEEE conferences). Today, I found <a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/">WikiCFP</a>, which is a <strong>A Wiki for Calls for
Papers</strong>. This seems to be what I needed. In particular, the following are very useful to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=machine%20learning">Machine Learning on WikiCFP</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=statistics">Statistics on WikiCFP</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It seems limited for statistics though, as JSM is not even listed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With all of the discussions (hype?) regarding applied statistics, machine learning, and data science, I have been looking for a go-to source of data unrelated to my day-to-day work. I loved baseball as
a kid. I love baseball now. I love baseball stats. Why not do a grown-up version of what I used to do when I spent hours staring at and memorizing baseball stats on the back of a few pieces of cardboard
on which I spent my allowance?</p>

<p>To get started, I purchased a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Hacks-Joseph-Adler/dp/0596009429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306290220&amp;sr=8-1">Baseball Hacks</a>. The author suggests the usage of MySQL,
so I will oblige. First, I downloaded some baseball data in MySQL format on my web server (Ubuntu 10.04) and decompressed it; when I downloaded the data, it was timestamped as 28 March 2011, so
double-check if there is an updated version.</p>

<p><code>bash
mkdir baseball
cd baseball
wget http://www.baseball-databank.org/files/BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql.zip
unzip BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql.zip
</code></p>

<p>Next, in MySQL I created a user named <strong>baseball</strong>, a database entitled <strong>bbdatabank</strong> and granted all privileges on this database to the user <strong>baseball</strong>. To do this, first open MySQL as root:</p>

<p><code>bash
mysql -u root -p
</code></p>

<p>At the MySQL prompt, type: (Note the tick marks (`) around <strong>bbdatabank</strong> when granting privileges.)</p>

<p><code>sql
CREATE USER 'baseball'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourPassword';
CREATE database bbdatabank;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `bbdatabank`.* TO 'baseball'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit
</code></p>

<p>Finally, we read the data into the database we just created by:</p>

<p><code>bash
mysql -u baseball -p -s bbdatabank &lt; BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql
</code></p>

<p>That’s it! Most of this code has been adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Hacks-Joseph-Adler/dp/0596009429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306290220&amp;sr=8-1">Baseball Hacks</a>, although I’ve tweaked a
couple of things. As I progress through the book, I will continue to add interesting finds and code as posts. Eventually, I will move away from the book’s code as it focuses too much on the
"Intro to Data Exploration" reader with constant mentions of MS Access/Excel. The author means well though as he urges the reader to use *nix/Mac OS X.</p>
