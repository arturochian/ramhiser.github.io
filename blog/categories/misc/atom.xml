    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2012/01/09/goals-for-2012/">goals for 2012</a> has been to blog more. Much more. When I first set this goal, I had great aspirations of posting frequently. However, I
had a Ph.D. to complete, and quite frankly, it demanded much higher priority. Now that I have submitted my dissertation and completed my Ph.D. requirements, I have several half-finished posts that will
appear soon. Also, since I have made the switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I will be relocating selected posts from my previous Wordpress blog.</p>
