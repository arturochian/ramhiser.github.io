    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Much of my research in machine learning is aimed at small-sample, high-dimensional bioinformatics data sets. For instance, here is <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00949655.2011.625946">a paper of mine on the topic</a>.</p>

<p>A large number of papers proposing new machine-learning methods that target high-dimensional data use the same two data sets and consider few others. These data sets are the 1) <a href="https://github.com/ramey/datamicroarray/wiki/Alon-%281999%29">Alon colon cancer data set</a>, and the 2) <a href="https://github.com/ramey/datamicroarray/wiki/Golub-%281999%29">Golub leukemia data set</a>. Both of the corresponding papers were published in 1999, which indicates that the methods are not keeping up with the data-collection techology. Furthermore, the Golub data set is not useful as a benchmark data set because it is well-separated so that most methods have nearly perfect classification.</p>

<p>My goal has been to find several alternative data sets and provide them in a convenient location so that I could load and analyze them easily and then incorporate the results into my papers. Initially, I aimed to identify a few more data sets, but after I got going on this effort, I found a lot more. What started as a small project turned into something that has saved me a lot of time. I have created the <a href="https://github.com/ramey/datamicroarray">datamicroarray package available from my GitHub account</a>. For each data set included in the package, I have provided a script to download, clean, and save the data set as a named list. See the <a href="https://github.com/ramey/datamicroarray/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> for more details about how the data are stored.</p>

<p>Currently, the package consists of 20 small-sample, high-dimensional data sets to assess machine learning algorithms and models. I have also included a <a href="https://github.com/ramey/datamicroarray/wiki">wiki on the packageâ€™s GitHub repository</a> that describes each data set and provides additional information, including a link to the original papers.</p>

<p>The biggest drawback at the moment is the file size of the R package because I store an RData file for each data set. I am investigating alternative approaches to download the data dynamically and am open to suggestions. Also note that the data descriptions are incomplete, so assistance is appreciated.</p>

<p>Feel free to use any of the data sets. As a disclaimer, you should ensure that the data are processed correctly before analyzing and incorporating the results into your own work.</p>
