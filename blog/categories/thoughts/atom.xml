    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was my 29th birthday, and I kept things simple: I ate with my wife and my newborn son at a local eatery. Later, my wife cooked steaks for dinner. For the most part, I took the day off in that I did not work on my dissertation. But I did spent much of the day tinkering with my <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> installation -- more about that later.</p>

<p>The best part of the day was hearing my son laugh again and again. Yes, there were some messy diapers, but those are easily forgotten when my son gets the giggles.</p>
