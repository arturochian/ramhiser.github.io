I am a postdoctoral research fellow in statistical genetics at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org) in the [Gottardo Lab](http://rglab.org/). Our focus is on developing methods for the automated analysis of high-throughput, multidimensional clinical flow cytometry data. Previously, I was a research associate in the [National Security Internship Program](http://science-ed.pnnl.gov/nsip/) at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](http://www.pnnl.gov/). Also, I have a Ph.D. in [Statistics](http://www.baylor.edu/Statistics/) from [Baylor University](http://www.baylor.edu/), where my Ph.D. adviser was [Dr. Dean Young](http://www.baylor.edu/Statistics/index.php?id=77525).

My research interests are primarily in statistics with an emphasis on bioinformatics applications in the areas of statistical pattern recognition, machine learning, modern multivariate analysis, computational statistics, and Bayesian methods. I write a lot of R code and work regularly with big data and high-performance computing.
