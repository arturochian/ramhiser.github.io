* **Abstract**. Classification of gene expression microarray data is important
in the diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, but often the analysis of
microarray data presents difficult challenges because the gene expression
dimension is typically much larger than the sample size. Consequently,
classification methods for microarray data often rely on regularization
techniques to stabilize the classifier for improved classification
performance. In particular, numerous regularization techniques, such as
covariance-matrix regularization, are available, which, in practice, lead to a
difficult choice of regularization methods. In this paper, we compare the
classification performance of five covariance-matrix regularization methods
applied to the linear discriminant function using two simulated high-dimensional
data sets and five well-known, high-dimensional microarray data sets. In our
simulation study, we found the minimum distance empirical Bayes method reported
in [Srivastava and Kubokawa (2007)](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/~srivasta/exp1.pdf) and the new linear discriminant analysis reported in [Thomaz, Kitani, and Gillies (2006)](http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03192391) to perform consistently well and often outperform three other prominent regularization methods. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for practitioners.
