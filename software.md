* [itertools2](https://github.com/ramhiser/itertools2) - This R package is a
  port of [Python's excellent itertools
  module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html) to R for efficient
  looping and is a replacement for the existing [itertools R
  package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/itertools/).

* [noncensus](https://github.com/ramhiser/noncensus) - This R package provides a
  collection of various regional information determined by the U.S. Census
  Bureau along with demographic data.

* [clusteval](https://github.com/ramhiser/clusteval) - An R package that
  provides a suite of tools to evaluate clustering algorithms, clusterings, and
  individual clusters.

* [sparsediscrim](https://github.com/ramhiser/sparsediscrim) - An R package that
  is a collection of sparse and regularized classification models intended for
  small-sample, high-dimensional data sets. The models include the well-known
  [Regularized Discriminant Analysis](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2289860)
  classifier and generalizations of the [Naive Bayes
  classifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).

* [pocketknife](https://github.com/ramhiser/pocketknife) - A collection of
  useful utility functions in R.

* [activelearning](https://github.com/ramhiser/activelearning) - An R package
  that implements [active
  learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_%28machine_learning%29),
  a machine learning paradigm for optimally choosing unlabeled observations in a
  training data set to query for their true labels.

* [datamicroarray](https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray) - An R package
  that provides a collection of scripts to download, process, and load
  small-sample, high-dimensional microarray data sets to assess machine learning
  algorithms and models. For each data set, we include a small set of scripts
  that automatically download, clean, and save the data set. Additionally, we
  include thorough descriptions and additional information about each microarray
  data set in the [package's
  wiki](https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/wiki). The majority of the
  microarary data sets included in the package are cancer-related.

* [sortinghat](https://github.com/ramhiser/sortinghat) - An R package that
  provides a variety of error-rate estimation methods for supervised
  classification. To assess classification performance, I have provided several
  widely known estimators, including random split / Monte-Carlo
  cross-validation, cross-validation, bootstrap, .632, .632+, apparent, and
  bolstering/smoothed error rates.
