I am a data scientist for [BlackLocus](http://blacklocus.com), the Home Depot
Innovation Lab. My current work focuses on the automation of data-driven
merchandising via statistics and machine learning.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in statistical genetics at the
[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org) in the [Gottardo
Lab](http://rglab.org/). My focus was on developing methods for the automated
analysis of high-throughput, multidimensional clinical flow cytometry
data. Prior to my postdoc, I was a research associate in the [National Security
Internship Program](http://science-ed.pnnl.gov/nsip/) at the [Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory](http://www.pnnl.gov/). Also, I have a Ph.D. in
[Statistics](http://www.baylor.edu/Statistics/) from [Baylor
University](http://www.baylor.edu/), where my Ph.D. adviser was [Dr. Dean
Young](http://www.baylor.edu/Statistics/index.php?id=77525).

My research interests are primarily in statistics in the areas of statistical
pattern recognition, machine learning, modern multivariate analysis,
computational statistics, and Bayesian methods. I write a lot of R and Python
code and work regularly with large data sets and high-performance computing.
