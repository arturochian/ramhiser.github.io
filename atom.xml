    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2012/01/09/goals-for-2012/">goals for 2012</a> has been to blog more. Much more. When I first set this goal, I had great aspirations of posting frequently. However, I
had a Ph.D. to complete, and quite frankly, it demanded much higher priority. Now that I have submitted my dissertation and completed my Ph.D. requirements, I have several half-finished posts that will
appear soon. Also, since I have made the switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I will be relocating selected posts from my previous Wordpress blog.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have never been one to set New Year&#8217;s resolutions. Personally, they instill a dangerous personal freedom that often yield naive, subconscious mentalities, such as I can do anything I want until December 31, and I will change abruptly the next day. However, my Ph.D. adviser has shown me the importance of setting goals in all things that I wish to accomplish as well as envisioning the finale to an arduous journey like a small child (read &#8220;John Ramey&#8221;) that pictures the waning warmth of fresh chocolate chip cookies smeared on his face. My adviser has always encouraged short-term and long-term goals but never required them. As I recently found out, my employer does. In addition, these goals are reviewed at the end of the fiscal year so that employees are realistic and held accountable.</p>

<p>Now that I must list these formally at work, I have decided to post a number of career and personal goals here in order to hold myself accountable at the end of 2012 with the implicit assumption that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">the world does not end</a>. So, one year from now, if we are still here (<strong>chuckle</strong>), I will review my goal-completion success.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read to my son (almost) nightly.</li>
<li>Hear my son laugh (almost) nightly.</li>
<li>Take my wife out for a date night each week.</li>
<li>Treat my wife to a significant outing each month.</li>
<li>Finish dissertation.</li>
<li>Successfully defend dissertation.</li>
<li>Submit 4-6 articles for publication.</li>
<li>Submit at least 3 R packages to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</li>
<li>Attend at least three conferences.</li>
<li>Make at least two conference presentations.</li>
<li>Find/maintain employment.</li>
<li>Construct detailed plan and outline for my textbook.</li>
<li>Take a real vacation.</li>
<li>Run a half marathon. (I will consider this a success if I have signed up for an early 2013 race.)</li>
<li>Transition my personal website from Wordpress to Octopress.</li>
<li>Blog more.</li>
<li>Check Tweets and email twice daily at a scheduled time.</li>
<li>Spend time with my extended family.</li>
<li>Read the literature at a scheduled time.</li>
<li>Finish reading Izenman&#8217;s Multivariate text.</li>
<li>Read Lehmann&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Statistician-Company-Kept-ebook/dp/B0016Q4P26/ref=wl_it_dp_o_npd?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I3T6NZ0PE0490O&amp;colid=2LV0B8J7GGR69">Reminiscences of a Statistician: The Company I Kept</a>.</li>
<li>Read Ewens and Grant&#8217;s bioinformatics text.</li>
<li>Read Bishop&#8217;s PRML text.</li>
<li>Read Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning.</li>
<li>Read Barber&#8217;s <a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Textbook">Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning</a>.</li>
<li>Read a significant portion of Devroye et al.&#8217;s Probabilistic Theory of Pattern Recognition text.</li>
<li>Reread Robert&#8217;s The Bayesian Choice.</li>
<li>Read Jaynes&#8217; Probability Theory text.</li>
<li>Read Berger&#8217;s Decision Theory text.</li>
<li>Watch Boyd&#8217;s Convex Optimization lectures.</li>
<li>Read the Boyd Convex Optimization text.</li>
<li>Finish reading Reamde.</li>
<li>Read Rothfuss&#8217; The Name of the Wind.</li>
<li>Become more proficient at debugging in R.</li>
</ul>


<p>As I have assuredly not remembered the goals that I have verbally set, this list may change over the next few days.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was my 29th birthday, and I kept things simple: I ate with my wife and my newborn son at a local eatery. Later, my wife cooked steaks for dinner. For the most part, I took the day off in that I did not work on my dissertation. But I did spent much of the day tinkering with my <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> installation &#8211; more about that later.</p>

<p>The best part of the day was hearing my son laugh again and again. Yes, there were some messy diapers, but those are easily forgotten when my son gets the giggles.</p>

    <link href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/05/24/getting-started-with-some-baseball-data/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-24T21:34:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/05/24/getting-started-with-some-baseball-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With all of the discussions (hype?) regarding applied statistics, machine learning, and data science, I have been looking for a go-to source of data unrelated to my day-to-day work. I loved baseball as
a kid. I love baseball now. I love baseball stats. Why not do a grown-up version of what I used to do when I spent hours staring at and memorizing baseball stats on the back of a few pieces of cardboard
on which I spent my allowance?</p>

<p>To get started, I purchased a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Hacks-Joseph-Adler/dp/0596009429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306290220&amp;sr=8-1">Baseball Hacks</a>. The author suggests the usage of MySQL,
so I will oblige. First, I downloaded some baseball data in MySQL format on my web server (Ubuntu 10.04) and decompressed it; when I downloaded the data, it was timestamped as 28 March 2011, so
double-check if there is an updated version.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mkdir baseball
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>baseball
</span><span class='line'>wget http://www.baseball-databank.org/files/BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql.zip
</span><span class='line'>unzip BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql.zip
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, in MySQL I created a user named <strong>baseball</strong>, a database entitled <strong>bbdatabank</strong> and granted all privileges on this database to the user <strong>baseball</strong>. To do this, first open MySQL as root:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mysql -u root -p
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At the MySQL prompt, type: (Note the tick marks (`) around <strong>bbdatabank</strong> when granting privileges.)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">USER</span> <span class="s1">&#39;baseball&#39;</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="s1">&#39;localhost&#39;</span> <span class="n">IDENTIFIED</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="s1">&#39;YourPassword&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">database</span> <span class="n">bbdatabank</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">GRANT</span> <span class="k">ALL</span> <span class="k">PRIVILEGES</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">bbdatabank</span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">TO</span> <span class="s1">&#39;baseball&#39;</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="s1">&#39;localhost&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">FLUSH</span> <span class="k">PRIVILEGES</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">quit</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, we read the data into the database we just created by:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mysql -u baseball -p -s bbdatabank &lt; BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That’s it! Most of this code has been adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Hacks-Joseph-Adler/dp/0596009429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306290220&amp;sr=8-1">Baseball Hacks</a>, although I’ve tweaked a
couple of things. As I progress through the book, I will continue to add interesting finds and code as posts. Eventually, I will move away from the book’s code as it focuses too much on the
&#8220;Intro to Data Exploration&#8221; reader with constant mentions of MS Access/Excel. The author means well though as he urges the reader to use *nix/Mac OS X.</p>
