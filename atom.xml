    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of my effort to acquaint myself more with biology, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics, I am trying to find as many resources as I can that provide a solid foundation. For instance, I am wading through <a href="http://amzn.to/Mx5jCm">Molecular Biology of the Cell</a> at a pace of about 10-15 pages per day – this takes nearly an hour every day.</p>

<p>I am also going through <a href="http://amzn.to/PiXCiU">Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics by Ewens and Grant</a> and working selected problems for each chapter. My intention is to post my solutions to these chapter exercises. Thus far, I have made it through the first three chapters, and I will begin posting my solutions soon. I am interested particularly in problems regarding statistical topics with which I have little-to-no experience and also topics where I lack intuition regarding the biological applications.</p>

<p>Here is a thumbnail of the book:</p>

    <id>http://ramhiser.com/blog/2012/08/11/now-that-we-live-in-seattle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been just a few weeks since <a href="http://ramhiserfamily.wordpress.com/">my wife, my son, and I</a> moved to Seattle so that I could begin my postdoc at <a href="http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html">The Hutch</a>. Now that we have been here a short time and are settled, we intend to start exploring Seattle, doing typical touristy things as well as non-touristy activities that only Seattlites would do. My wife purchased a detailed guide to Seattle that lists numerous activities, restaurants, scenery, etc. that would take months (years?) to complete. I prefer word of mouth though, so I asked some coworkers for recommendations. Here’s what they gave me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.spaceneedle.com/">The Space Needle</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/">Pike Place Market</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ridetheslut.com/">Ride The Slut</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.chandlerscrabhouse.com/">Chandler’s Crabhouse</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/">Seattle Art Museum</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/discovery.htm">Discovery Park</a></li>
  <li>Walk around the <a href="http://www.myballard.com/">Ballard neighborhood</a> – in particular, the Northwest Market.</li>
  <li><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwbg/gardens/wpa.shtml">The Arboretum</a> near <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">UW</a></li>
  <li>Take a ferry to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington">Bainbridge Island</a></li>
  <li>The new <a href="http://seattlegreatwheel.com/">ferris wheel</a> in downtown Seattle</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.3pubs.com/Latona.html">Latona Pub</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My coworkers recommended parking at <a href="http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html">The Hutch</a> and riding <a href="http://ridetheslut.com/">The Slut</a> to <a href="http://www.westlakecenter.com/">Westlake Center</a> and then walking to <a href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/">Pike Place</a> – avoids traffic. Also, they recommended thta we combine <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/discovery.htm">Discovery Park</a> and Ballard into one day. They said the view of Seattle from the ferry when returning from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington">Bainbridge Island</a> is breathtaking.</p>

<p>My wife and I like to hike, so I also asked my coworkers for recommendations. Overwhelmingly, they said these two places:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lake-1/">Snow Lake</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/seasonal-hikes/hikes-of-the-week/middle-fork-snoqualmie-river">Middle Fork</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Any other recommendations? In particular, are there any restaurants that you’d recommend?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2012/01/09/goals-for-2012/">goals for 2012</a> has been to blog more. Much more. When I first set this goal, I had great aspirations of posting frequently. However, I
had a Ph.D. to complete, and quite frankly, it demanded much higher priority. Now that I have submitted my dissertation and completed my Ph.D. requirements, I have several half-finished posts that will
appear soon. Also, since I have made the switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I will be relocating selected posts from my previous Wordpress blog.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have never been one to set New Year’s resolutions. Personally, they instill a dangerous personal freedom that often yield naive, subconscious mentalities, such as I can do anything I want until December 31, and I will change abruptly the next day. However, my Ph.D. adviser has shown me the importance of setting goals in all things that I wish to accomplish as well as envisioning the finale to an arduous journey like a small child (read “John Ramey”) that pictures the waning warmth of fresh chocolate chip cookies smeared on his face. My adviser has always encouraged short-term and long-term goals but never required them. As I recently found out, my employer does. In addition, these goals are reviewed at the end of the fiscal year so that employees are realistic and held accountable.</p>

<p>Now that I must list these formally at work, I have decided to post a number of career and personal goals here in order to hold myself accountable at the end of 2012 with the implicit assumption that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">the world does not end</a>. So, one year from now, if we are still here (<strong>chuckle</strong>), I will review my goal-completion success.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read to my son (almost) nightly.</li>
  <li>Hear my son laugh (almost) nightly.</li>
  <li>Take my wife out for a date night each week.</li>
  <li>Treat my wife to a significant outing each month.</li>
  <li>Finish dissertation.</li>
  <li>Successfully defend dissertation.</li>
  <li>Submit 4-6 articles for publication.</li>
  <li>Submit at least 3 R packages to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</li>
  <li>Attend at least three conferences.</li>
  <li>Make at least two conference presentations.</li>
  <li>Find/maintain employment.</li>
  <li>Construct detailed plan and outline for my textbook.</li>
  <li>Take a real vacation.</li>
  <li>Run a half marathon. (I will consider this a success if I have signed up for an early 2013 race.)</li>
  <li>Transition my personal website from Wordpress to Octopress.</li>
  <li>Blog more.</li>
  <li>Check Tweets and email twice daily at a scheduled time.</li>
  <li>Spend time with my extended family.</li>
  <li>Read the literature at a scheduled time.</li>
  <li>Finish reading Izenman’s Multivariate text.</li>
  <li>Read Lehmann’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Statistician-Company-Kept-ebook/dp/B0016Q4P26/ref=wl_it_dp_o_npd?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I3T6NZ0PE0490O&amp;colid=2LV0B8J7GGR69">Reminiscences of a Statistician: The Company I Kept</a>.</li>
  <li>Read Ewens and Grant’s bioinformatics text.</li>
  <li>Read Bishop’s PRML text.</li>
  <li>Read Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning.</li>
  <li>Read Barber’s <a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Textbook">Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning</a>.</li>
  <li>Read a significant portion of Devroye et al.’s Probabilistic Theory of Pattern Recognition text.</li>
  <li>Reread Robert’s The Bayesian Choice.</li>
  <li>Read Jaynes’ Probability Theory text.</li>
  <li>Read Berger’s Decision Theory text.</li>
  <li>Watch Boyd’s Convex Optimization lectures.</li>
  <li>Read the Boyd Convex Optimization text.</li>
  <li>Finish reading Reamde.</li>
  <li>Read Rothfuss’ The Name of the Wind.</li>
  <li>Become more proficient at debugging in R.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I have assuredly not remembered the goals that I have verbally set, this list may change over the next few days.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was my 29th birthday, and I kept things simple: I ate with my wife and my newborn son at a local eatery. Later, my wife cooked steaks for dinner. For the most part, I took the day off in that I did not work on my dissertation. But I did spent much of the day tinkering with my <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> installation – more about that later.</p>

<p>The best part of the day was hearing my son laugh again and again. Yes, there were some messy diapers, but those are easily forgotten when my son gets the giggles.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given that there are almost 13 million views of Steve Jobs’ commencement address, I am certain that I missed this video when it went viral. I am glad that I did not see it until now because I may not have appreciated his words of wisdom. And although there are numerous quotes that I could list, I think my favorites are closely related to a few words of wisdom that my grandmother told me when I was younger.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t settle.</p><p>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</p><p>You’ve got to find what you love, and that is as true for work as is for your lovers. Your work is gonna fill a large part of your life, and the only way to truly be satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.</p><footer><strong>Steve Jobs</strong> <cite><a href="http://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc">youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>It’s good to be reminded of things like this once in a while.</p>

    <link href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/11/25/pseudo-random-vs-random-numbers-in-r/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-25T03:08:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/11/25/pseudo-random-vs-random-numbers-in-r</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier, I found <a href="http://www.boallen.com/random-numbers.html">an interesting post from Bo Allen</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudo-random</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number">random numbers</a>, where the author uses a simple bitmap (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map">heat map</a>) to show that the <strong>rand</strong> function in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> has a systematic pattern and compares these to <strong>truly random</strong> numbers obtained from <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. The post’s results suggest that pseudo-randomness in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is faulty and, in general, should not be underestimated in practice. Of course, the findings should not be too surprising, as there is a large body of literature on the subtleties, philosophies, and implications of the <strong>pseudo</strong> aspect of the most common approaches to random number generation. However, it is silly that <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">random number generator (RNG)</a> displays such an obvious pattern nowadays because there are several decent, well-studied pseudo-RNG algorithms available as well as numerous tests for randomness.  For a good introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a>, I recommend <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/12/06/how-to-test-a-random-number-generator-2/">John D. Cook’s discussion on testing a random number generator</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I would never use <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> for any (serious) statistical analysis, partly due to my fondness for <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, nor do I doubt the practicality of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a> in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. But I was curious to see what would happen. So, created equivalent plots in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to see if a <strong>rand</strong> equivalent would exhibit a systematic pattern like in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, even if less severe. Also, for comparison, I chose to use <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/random/index.html">the <strong>random</strong> package</a>, from <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/">Dirk Eddelbuettel</a>, to draw <strong>truly random</strong> numbers from <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. Until today, I had only heard of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/random/index.html">the <strong>random</strong> package</a> but had never used it.</p>

<p>I have provided the function <strong>rand_bit_matrix</strong>, which requires the number of rows and columns to display in the plotted bitmap. To create the bitmaps, I used <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pixmap/index.html">the <strong>pixmap</strong> package</a> rather than <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">the much-loved <strong>ggplot2</strong> package</a>, simply because of how easy it was for me to create the plots. (If you are concerned that I have lost the faith, please note that I am aware of the awesomeness of <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/"><strong>ggplot2</strong></a> and <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/06/05/conways-game-of-life-in-r-with-ggplot2-and-animation/">its ability</a> <a href="http://learnr.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/ggplot2-quick-heatmap-plotting/">to create heat maps</a>.)</p>

<p>It is important to note that there were two challenges that I encountered when using drawing <strong>truly random numbers</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only 10,000 numbers can be drawn at once from <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. (This is denoted as <strong>max_n_random.org</strong> in the function below.)</li>
  <li>There is a daily limit to the number of times the <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a> service will provide numbers.</li>
</ol>

<p>To overcome the first challenge, I split the total number of bits into separate calls, if necessary. This approach, however, increases our number of requests, and after too many requests, you will see the error: <strong>random.org suggests to wait until tomorrow</strong>. Currently, I do not know the exact number of allowed requests or if the amount of requested random numbers is a factor, but looking back, I would guess about 20ish large requests is too much.</p>

<p>Below, I have plotted 500 x 500 bitmaps based on the <em>random</em> bits from both of <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. As far as I can tell, no apparent patterns are visible in either plot, but from the graphics alone, our conclusions are limited to ruling out obvious systematic patterns, which were exhibited from the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> code. I am unsure if the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> folks formally tested their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a> algorithms for <strong>randomness</strong>, but even if they did, the code in both <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is straightforward and provides a quick eyeball test. Armed with similar plots alone, the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> devs could have sought for better <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a> algorithms — perhaps, borrowed those from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Occasionally, I will query Google with “statistics conferences”, “machine learning conferences” or “pattern recognition conferences” and the like. But often, it is difficult to obtain anything
meaningful other than the conferences of which I’m already aware (such as JSM, ICML, some IEEE conferences). Today, I found <a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/">WikiCFP</a>, which is a <strong>A Wiki for Calls for
Papers</strong>. This seems to be what I needed. In particular, the following are very useful to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=machine%20learning">Machine Learning on WikiCFP</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=statistics">Statistics on WikiCFP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems limited for statistics though, as JSM is not even listed.</p>

    <updated>2011-06-05T19:04:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/06/05/conways-game-of-life-in-r-with-ggplot2-and-animation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In undergrad I had a computer science professor that piqued my interest in applied mathematics, beginning with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>. At first, the Game of Life (not the board game) appears to be quite simple — perhaps, too simple — but it has been widely explored and is useful for modeling systems over time. It has been forever since I wrote my first version of this in C++, and I happily report that there will be no nonsense here.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to start with a grid of cells, where each cell is either a zero (dead) or a one (alive). We are interested in watching the population behavior over time to see if the population dies off, has some sort of equilibrium, etc. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a> studied many possible ways to examine population behaviors and ultimately decided on the following rules, which we apply to each cell for the current tick (or generation).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
</ol>

<p>Although there are <a href="http://www.statisticsblog.com/2010/05/game-of-life-in-r/">other versions</a> of this in R, I decided to give it a shot myself. I am not going to provide a walkthrough of the code as I may normally do, but the code should be simple enough to understand for one proficient in R. It may have been unnecessary to implement this with the foreach package, but I wanted to get some more familiarity with foreach, so I did.</p>

<p>The set of grids is stored as a list, where each element is a matrix of zeros and ones. Each matrix is then converted to an image with ggplot2, and the sequence of images is exported as a MP4 video with the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html">animation package</a>.</p>

<p>Let me know if you improve on my code any. I’m always interested in learning how to do things better.</p>

<p>As an example, I have created a 50-by-50 grid with a 10% chance that its initial values will be alive. The simulation has 500 iterations. You may add more, but this takes long enough already. Note
that the default frame rate, which is controlled by <strong>interval</strong>, is 1 second. I set it to 0.05
based to give a decent video.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With all of the discussions (hype?) regarding applied statistics, machine learning, and data science, I have been looking for a go-to source of data unrelated to my day-to-day work. I loved baseball as
a kid. I love baseball now. I love baseball stats. Why not do a grown-up version of what I used to do when I spent hours staring at and memorizing baseball stats on the back of a few pieces of cardboard
on which I spent my allowance?</p>

<p>To get started, I purchased a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Hacks-Joseph-Adler/dp/0596009429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306290220&amp;sr=8-1">Baseball Hacks</a>. The author suggests the usage of MySQL,
so I will oblige. First, I downloaded some baseball data in MySQL format on my web server (Ubuntu 10.04) and decompressed it; when I downloaded the data, it was timestamped as 28 March 2011, so
double-check if there is an updated version.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">mkdir baseball
</span><span class="line"><span class="nb">cd </span>baseball
</span><span class="line">wget http://www.baseball-databank.org/files/BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql.zip
</span><span class="line">unzip BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql.zip
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Next, in MySQL I created a user named <strong>baseball</strong>, a database entitled <strong>bbdatabank</strong> and granted all privileges on this database to the user <strong>baseball</strong>. To do this, first open MySQL as root:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">mysql -u root -p
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>At the MySQL prompt, type: (Note the tick marks (`) around <strong>bbdatabank</strong> when granting privileges.)</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="sql"><span class="line"><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">USER</span> <span class="s1">&#39;baseball&#39;</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="s1">&#39;localhost&#39;</span> <span class="n">IDENTIFIED</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="s1">&#39;YourPassword&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">database</span> <span class="n">bbdatabank</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">GRANT</span> <span class="k">ALL</span> <span class="k">PRIVILEGES</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">bbdatabank</span><span class="o">`</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">TO</span> <span class="s1">&#39;baseball&#39;</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="s1">&#39;localhost&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">FLUSH</span> <span class="k">PRIVILEGES</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">quit</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Finally, we read the data into the database we just created by:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">mysql -u baseball -p -s bbdatabank &lt; BDB-sql-2011-03-28.sql
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>That’s it! Most of this code has been adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Hacks-Joseph-Adler/dp/0596009429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1306290220&amp;sr=8-1">Baseball Hacks</a>, although I’ve tweaked a
couple of things. As I progress through the book, I will continue to add interesting finds and code as posts. Eventually, I will move away from the book’s code as it focuses too much on the
“Intro to Data Exploration” reader with constant mentions of MS Access/Excel. The author means well though as he urges the reader to use *nix/Mac OS X.</p>
