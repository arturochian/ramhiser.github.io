These are my notes on a variety of topics ranging from statistics and machine learning to R to emacs. My intention is to provide a brief summary of these topics for quick reference and implementation purposes. They are subject to change and may be incomplete at times. If you find any mistakes, please let me know. All equations are rendered with MathJax.
