I am nearly finished with my Ph.D. in Statistics at Baylor University. My research interests are primarily in statistics with an emphasis on bioinformatics applications in the areas of statistical pattern recognition, machine learning, modern multivariate analysis, computational statistics, and Bayesian methods. I write a lot of R code and work regularly with big data and high-performance computing.
