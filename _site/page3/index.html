        Goals for 2012
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>I have never been one to set New Year’s resolutions. Personally, they instill a dangerous personal freedom that often yield naive, subconscious mentalities, such as I can do anything I want until December 31, and I will change abruptly the next day. However, my Ph.D. adviser has shown me the importance of setting goals in all things that I wish to accomplish as well as envisioning the finale to an arduous journey like a small child (read “John Ramey”) that pictures the waning warmth of fresh chocolate chip cookies smeared on his face. My adviser has always encouraged short-term and long-term goals but never required them. As I recently found out, my employer does. In addition, these goals are reviewed at the end of the fiscal year so that employees are realistic and held accountable.</p>

<p>Now that I must list these formally at work, I have decided to post a number of career and personal goals here in order to hold myself accountable at the end of 2012 with the implicit assumption that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">the world does not end</a>. So, one year from now, if we are still here (<strong>chuckle</strong>), I will review my goal-completion success.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read to my son (almost) nightly.</li>
  <li>Hear my son laugh (almost) nightly.</li>
  <li>Take my wife out for a date night each week.</li>
  <li>Treat my wife to a significant outing each month.</li>
  <li>Finish dissertation.</li>
  <li>Successfully defend dissertation.</li>
  <li>Submit 4-6 articles for publication.</li>
  <li>Submit at least 3 R packages to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</li>
  <li>Attend at least three conferences.</li>
  <li>Make at least two conference presentations.</li>
  <li>Find/maintain employment.</li>
  <li>Construct detailed plan and outline for my textbook.</li>
  <li>Take a real vacation.</li>
  <li>Run a half marathon. (I will consider this a success if I have signed up for an early 2013 race.)</li>
  <li>Transition my personal website from Wordpress to Octopress.</li>
  <li>Blog more.</li>
  <li>Check Tweets and email twice daily at a scheduled time.</li>
  <li>Spend time with my extended family.</li>
  <li>Read the literature at a scheduled time.</li>
  <li>Finish reading Izenman’s Multivariate text.</li>
  <li>Read Lehmann’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Statistician-Company-Kept-ebook/dp/B0016Q4P26/ref=wl_it_dp_o_npd?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I3T6NZ0PE0490O&amp;colid=2LV0B8J7GGR69">Reminiscences of a Statistician: The Company I Kept</a>.</li>
  <li>Read Ewens and Grant’s bioinformatics text.</li>
  <li>Read Bishop’s PRML text.</li>
  <li>Read Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning.</li>
  <li>Read Barber’s <a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Textbook">Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning</a>.</li>
  <li>Read a significant portion of Devroye et al.’s Probabilistic Theory of Pattern Recognition text.</li>
  <li>Reread Robert’s The Bayesian Choice.</li>
  <li>Read Jaynes’ Probability Theory text.</li>
  <li>Read Berger’s Decision Theory text.</li>
  <li>Watch Boyd’s Convex Optimization lectures.</li>
  <li>Read the Boyd Convex Optimization text.</li>
  <li>Finish reading Reamde.</li>
  <li>Read Rothfuss’ The Name of the Wind.</li>
  <li>Become more proficient at debugging in R.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I have assuredly not remembered the goals that I have verbally set, this list may change over the next few days.</p>

        When I was 29...
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>Today was my 29th birthday, and I kept things simple: I ate with my wife and my newborn son at a local eatery. Later, my wife cooked steaks for dinner. For the most part, I took the day off in that I did not work on my dissertation. But I did spent much of the day tinkering with my <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> installation – more about that later.</p>

<p>The best part of the day was hearing my son laugh again and again. Yes, there were some messy diapers, but those are easily forgotten when my son gets the giggles.</p>

        Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2011</span>

    <p>Given that there are almost 13 million views of Steve Jobs’ commencement address, I am certain that I missed this video when it went viral. I am glad that I did not see it until now because I may not have appreciated his words of wisdom. And although there are numerous quotes that I could list, I think my favorites are closely related to a few words of wisdom that my grandmother told me when I was younger.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t settle.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’ve got to find what you love, and that is as true for work as is for your lovers. Your work is gonna fill a large part of your life, and the only way to truly be satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s good to be reminded of things like this once in a while.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After migrating to Jekyll 2.0 on GitHub pages, Jekyll is run in <strong>safe</strong> mode, so 3rd-party plugins are disabled. This includes the <strong>youtube</strong> plugin I was using previously. Maybe one day I’ll be able to add the video here via <code>%youtube UF8uR6Z6KLc %</code></p>

        Pseudo-Random vs. Random Numbers in R
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>Earlier, I found <a href="http://www.boallen.com/random-numbers.html">an interesting post from Bo Allen</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudo-random</a> vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number">random numbers</a>, where the author uses a simple bitmap (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map">heat map</a>) to show that the <strong>rand</strong> function in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> has a systematic pattern and compares these to <strong>truly random</strong> numbers obtained from <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. The post’s results suggest that pseudo-randomness in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is faulty and, in general, should not be underestimated in practice. Of course, the findings should not be too surprising, as there is a large body of literature on the subtleties, philosophies, and implications of the <strong>pseudo</strong> aspect of the most common approaches to random number generation. However, it is silly that <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">random number generator (RNG)</a> displays such an obvious pattern nowadays because there are several decent, well-studied pseudo-RNG algorithms available as well as numerous tests for randomness.  For a good introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a>, I recommend <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/12/06/how-to-test-a-random-number-generator-2/">John D. Cook’s discussion on testing a random number generator</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I would never use <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> for any (serious) statistical analysis, partly due to my fondness for <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, nor do I doubt the practicality of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a> in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. But I was curious to see what would happen. So, created equivalent plots in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to see if a <strong>rand</strong> equivalent would exhibit a systematic pattern like in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, even if less severe. Also, for comparison, I chose to use <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/random/index.html">the <strong>random</strong> package</a>, from <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/">Dirk Eddelbuettel</a>, to draw <strong>truly random</strong> numbers from <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. Until today, I had only heard of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/random/index.html">the <strong>random</strong> package</a> but had never used it.</p>

<p>I have provided the function <strong>rand_bit_matrix</strong>, which requires the number of rows and columns to display in the plotted bitmap. To create the bitmaps, I used <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pixmap/index.html">the <strong>pixmap</strong> package</a> rather than <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">the much-loved <strong>ggplot2</strong> package</a>, simply because of how easy it was for me to create the plots. (If you are concerned that I have lost the faith, please note that I am aware of the awesomeness of <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/"><strong>ggplot2</strong></a> and <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2011/06/05/conways-game-of-life-in-r-with-ggplot2-and-animation/">its ability</a> <a href="http://learnr.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/ggplot2-quick-heatmap-plotting/">to create heat maps</a>.)</p>

<p>It is important to note that there were two challenges that I encountered when using drawing <strong>truly random numbers</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only 10,000 numbers can be drawn at once from <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. (This is denoted as <strong>max_n_random.org</strong> in the function below.)</li>
  <li>There is a daily limit to the number of times the <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a> service will provide numbers.</li>
</ol>

<p>To overcome the first challenge, I split the total number of bits into separate calls, if necessary. This approach, however, increases our number of requests, and after too many requests, you will see the error: <strong>random.org suggests to wait until tomorrow</strong>. Currently, I do not know the exact number of allowed requests or if the amount of requested random numbers is a factor, but looking back, I would guess about 20ish large requests is too much.</p>

<p>Below, I have plotted 500 x 500 bitmaps based on the <em>random</em> bits from both of <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a>. As far as I can tell, no apparent patterns are visible in either plot, but from the graphics alone, our conclusions are limited to ruling out obvious systematic patterns, which were exhibited from the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> code. I am unsure if the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> folks formally tested their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a> algorithms for <strong>randomness</strong>, but even if they did, the code in both <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is straightforward and provides a quick eyeball test. Armed with similar plots alone, the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> devs could have sought for better <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">RNG</a> algorithms — perhaps, borrowed those from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>

        Listing of Statistics and Machine Learning Conferences

    <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2011</span>

    <p>Occasionally, I will query Google with “statistics conferences”, “machine learning conferences” or “pattern recognition conferences” and the like. But often, it is difficult to obtain anything
meaningful other than the conferences of which I’m already aware (such as JSM, ICML, some IEEE conferences). Today, I found <a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/">WikiCFP</a>, which is a <strong>A Wiki for Calls for
Papers</strong>. This seems to be what I needed. In particular, the following are very useful to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=machine%20learning">Machine Learning on WikiCFP</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=statistics">Statistics on WikiCFP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems limited for statistics though, as JSM is not even listed.</p>
