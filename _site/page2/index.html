        Chapter 2 Solutions - Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>As I have mentioned previously, I have begun reading <a href="http://amzn.to/PiXCiU">Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics by Ewens and Grant</a> and working selected problems for each chapter. In this post, I will give my solution to two problems. The first problem is pretty straightforward.</p>

<h2>Problem 2.20</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that a parent of genetic type <em>Mm</em> has three children. Then the parent transmits the <em>M</em> gene to each child with probability 1/2, and <strong>the genes that are transmitted to each of the three children are independent</strong>. Let $$I<em>1 = 1$$ if children 1 and 2 had the same gene transmitted, and $$I</em>1 = 0$$ otherwise. Similarly, let $$I<em>2 = 1$$ if children 1 and 3 had the same gene transmitted, $$I</em>2 = 0$$ otherwhise, and let $$I<em>3 = 1$$ if children 2 and 3 had the same gene transmitted, $$I</em>3 = 0$$ otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question first asks us to how that the three random variables are pairwise independent but not independent. The pairwise independence comes directly from the bolded phrase in the problem statement. Now, to show that the three random variables are not independent, denote by $$p<em>j$$ the probability that $$I</em>j = 1$$, $$j = 1, 2, 3$$. If we had independence, then the following statement would be true:</p>

<p>$$
P(I<em>1 = 1, I</em>2 = 1, I<em>3 = 0) = p</em>1 p<em>2 (1 - p</em>3).
$$</p>

<p>However, notice that the event in the lefthand side can never happen because if $$I<em>1 = 1$$ and $$I</em>2 = 1$$, then $$I_3$$ must be 1. Hence, the lefthand side must equal 0, while the righthand side equals 1/8. Therefore, the three random variables are not independent.</p>

<p>The question also asks us to discuss why the variance of $$I<em>1 + I</em>2 + I_3$$ is equal to the sum of the individual variances. Often, this is only the case of the random variables are independent. But because the random variables here are pairwise independent, the covariances must be 0. Thus, the equality must hold.</p>

<h2>Problems 2.23 - 2.27</h2>

<p>While I worked the above problem because of its emphasis on genetics, the following set of problems is much more fun in terms of the mathematics because of its usage of approximations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For $$i = 1, \ldots, n$$, let $$X<em>i$$ be the $$i$$th lifetime of certain cellular proteins until degradation. We assume that $$X</em>1, \ldots, X_n$$ are iid random variables, each of which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponentially distributed</a> with rate parameter $$\lambda &gt; 0$$. Furthermore, let $$n = 2m + 1$$ be an odd integer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This set of questions is concerned with the mean and variance of the sample median, $$X<em>{(m + 1)}$$, where $$X</em>{(i)}$$ denotes the $$i$$th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic">order statistic</a>. First, note that the mean and variance of the minimum value $$X<em>{(1)}$$ are $$1/(n\lambda)$$ and $$1/(n\lambda)^2$$, respectively. From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness#The_memoryless_distributions_are_the_exponential_distributions">memoryless property</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a>, the mean value of the time until the next protein degrades is independent of the previous. However, there are now $$n - 1$$ proteins remaining. Thus, the mean and variance of $$X</em>{(2)}$$ are $$1/(n\lambda) + 1/((n-1)\lambda)$$ and $$1/(n\lambda)^2 + 1/((n-1)\lambda)^2$$, respectively. Continuining in this manner, we have</p>

<p>$$
E[X_{(m + 1)}] = \frac{1}{(2m + 1)\lambda} + \frac{1}{(2m)\lambda} + \ldots + \frac{1}{(m + 1)\lambda}
$$</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$
Var[X_{(m + 1)}] = \frac{1}{(2m + 1)^2\lambda^2} + \frac{1}{(2m)^2\lambda^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{(m + 1)^2\lambda^2}.
$$</p>

<h3>Approximation of $$E[X_{(m + 1)}]$$</h3>

<p>Now, we wish to approximate the mean with a much simpler formula. First, from (B.7) in Appendix B, we have</p>

<p>$$
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} \approx \log n + \gamma,
$$</p>

<p>where $$\gamma$$ is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant">Euler&#39;s constant</a>. Then, we can write the expected sample median as</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
E[X<em>{(m + 1)}] &amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum</em>{k=m+1}^{2m+1} \frac{1}{k}\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda} \left(\sum<em>{k=1}^{2m+1} \frac{1}{k} - \sum</em>{k=1}^{m} \frac{1}{k} \right)\
&amp;\approx \frac{1}{\lambda} \left( \log (2m + 1) + \gamma - \log m - \gamma \right)\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda} \log \left(2 + \frac{1}{m} \right).
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>Hence, as $$n \rightarrow \infty$$, this approximation goes to $$ \frac{\log 2}{\lambda}$$, which is the median of an exponentially distributed random variable. Specifically, the median is the solution to $$F<em>X(x) = 1/2$$, where $$F</em>X$$ denotes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">cumulative distribution function</a> of the random variable $$X$$.</p>

<h3>Improved Approximation of $$E[X_{(m + 1)}]$$</h3>

<p>It turns out that we can improve this approximation with the following two results:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} &amp;= \log n + \frac{1}{2n} + o\left(\frac{1}{n}\right),\
\log \left(\frac{2m + 1}{m}\right) &amp;= \log 2 + \frac{1}{2m} + o\left(\frac{1}{m}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>Following the derivation of our above approximation, we have that</p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
E[X<em>{(m + 1)}] &amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda} \left(\sum</em>{k=1}^{2m+1} \frac{1}{k} - \sum_{k=1}^{m} \frac{1}{k} \right)\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda} \left( \log (2m + 1) + \gamma - \log m - \gamma \right)\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\lambda} \left[ \log \left( \frac{2m + 1}{m} \right) + \frac{1}{2(2m+1)} - \frac{1}{2m} + o\left(\frac{1}{m}\right)  \right]\
&amp;= \frac{\log 2}{\lambda} + \frac{1}{2\lambda (2m + 1)} + o\left(\frac{1}{m}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<h3>Approximation of $$Var[X_{(m + 1)}]$$</h3>

<p>We can also approximate $$Var[X_{(m + 1)}]$$ using the approximation</p>

<p>$$
\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{(a+1)^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{b^2} \approx \frac{1}{a - 1/2} - \frac{1}{b + 1/2}.
$$</p>

<p>With $$a = m+1$$ and $$b = 2m + 1$$, we have</p>

<p>$$
Var[X_{(m + 1)}] \approx \frac{2}{\lambda^2} + o\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right).
$$</p>

    <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>As part of my effort to acquaint myself more with biology, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics, I am trying to find as many resources as I can that provide a solid foundation. For instance, I am wading through <a href="http://amzn.to/Mx5jCm">Molecular Biology of the Cell</a> at a pace of about 10-15 pages per day -- this takes nearly an hour every day.</p>

<p>I am also going through <a href="http://amzn.to/PiXCiU">Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics by Ewens and Grant</a> and working selected problems for each chapter. My intention is to post my solutions to these chapter exercises. Thus far, I have made it through the first three chapters, and I will begin posting my solutions soon. I am interested particularly in problems regarding statistical topics with which I have little-to-no experience and also topics where I lack intuition regarding the biological applications.</p>

<p>Here is a thumbnail of the book:</p>

        Now That We Live in Seattle

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>It has been just a few weeks since <a href="http://ramhiserfamily.wordpress.com/">my wife, my son, and I</a> moved to Seattle so that I could begin my postdoc at <a href="http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html">The Hutch</a>. Now that we have been here a short time and are settled, we intend to start exploring Seattle, doing typical touristy things as well as non-touristy activities that only Seattlites would do. My wife purchased a detailed guide to Seattle that lists numerous activities, restaurants, scenery, etc. that would take months (years?) to complete. I prefer word of mouth though, so I asked some coworkers for recommendations. Here&#39;s what they gave me:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.spaceneedle.com/">The Space Needle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/">Pike Place Market</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ridetheslut.com/">Ride The Slut</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.chandlerscrabhouse.com/">Chandler&#39;s Crabhouse</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/">Seattle Art Museum</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/discovery.htm">Discovery Park</a></li>
<li>Walk around the <a href="http://www.myballard.com/">Ballard neighborhood</a> -- in particular, the Northwest Market.</li>
<li><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwbg/gardens/wpa.shtml">The Arboretum</a> near <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">UW</a></li>
<li>Take a ferry to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington">Bainbridge Island</a></li>
<li>The new <a href="http://seattlegreatwheel.com/">ferris wheel</a> in downtown Seattle</li>
<li><a href="http://www.3pubs.com/Latona.html">Latona Pub</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My coworkers recommended parking at <a href="http://www.fhcrc.org/en.html">The Hutch</a> and riding <a href="http://ridetheslut.com/">The Slut</a> to <a href="http://www.westlakecenter.com/">Westlake Center</a> and then walking to <a href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/">Pike Place</a> -- avoids traffic. Also, they recommended thta we combine <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/environment/discovery.htm">Discovery Park</a> and Ballard into one day. They said the view of Seattle from the ferry when returning from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington">Bainbridge Island</a> is breathtaking.</p>

<p>My wife and I like to hike, so I also asked my coworkers for recommendations. Overwhelmingly, they said these two places:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lake-1/">Snow Lake</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/seasonal-hikes/hikes-of-the-week/middle-fork-snoqualmie-river">Middle Fork</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Any other recommendations? In particular, are there any restaurants that you&#39;d recommend?</p>

    <p>One of my <a href="http://ramhiser.com/blog/2012/01/09/goals-for-2012/">goals for 2012</a> has been to blog more. Much more. When I first set this goal, I had great aspirations of posting frequently. However, I
had a Ph.D. to complete, and quite frankly, it demanded much higher priority. Now that I have submitted my dissertation and completed my Ph.D. requirements, I have several half-finished posts that will
appear soon. Also, since I have made the switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, I will be relocating selected posts from my previous Wordpress blog.</p>

    <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>I have never been one to set New Year&#39;s resolutions. Personally, they instill a dangerous personal freedom that often yield naive, subconscious mentalities, such as I can do anything I want until December 31, and I will change abruptly the next day. However, my Ph.D. adviser has shown me the importance of setting goals in all things that I wish to accomplish as well as envisioning the finale to an arduous journey like a small child (read &quot;John Ramey&quot;) that pictures the waning warmth of fresh chocolate chip cookies smeared on his face. My adviser has always encouraged short-term and long-term goals but never required them. As I recently found out, my employer does. In addition, these goals are reviewed at the end of the fiscal year so that employees are realistic and held accountable.</p>

<p>Now that I must list these formally at work, I have decided to post a number of career and personal goals here in order to hold myself accountable at the end of 2012 with the implicit assumption that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">the world does not end</a>. So, one year from now, if we are still here (<strong>chuckle</strong>), I will review my goal-completion success.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read to my son (almost) nightly.</li>
<li>Hear my son laugh (almost) nightly.</li>
<li>Take my wife out for a date night each week.</li>
<li>Treat my wife to a significant outing each month.</li>
<li>Finish dissertation.</li>
<li>Successfully defend dissertation.</li>
<li>Submit 4-6 articles for publication.</li>
<li>Submit at least 3 R packages to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</li>
<li>Attend at least three conferences.</li>
<li>Make at least two conference presentations.</li>
<li>Find/maintain employment.</li>
<li>Construct detailed plan and outline for my textbook.</li>
<li>Take a real vacation.</li>
<li>Run a half marathon. (I will consider this a success if I have signed up for an early 2013 race.)</li>
<li>Transition my personal website from Wordpress to Octopress.</li>
<li>Blog more.</li>
<li>Check Tweets and email twice daily at a scheduled time.</li>
