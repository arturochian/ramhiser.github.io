proposed a discriminant analysis model based on a mixture of Gaussians, each of
which share a common covariance matrix. The mixture discriminant analysis (MDA)
model provides a natural extension of the standard Gaussian assumptions
underlying the well-known linear and quadratic discriminant analysis
methods. However, because the estimators for the model have no closed-form, an
EM algorithm was used. In this document, we provide a verbose construction of
the model along with a thorough derivation of the parameter estimators as some
of the details from <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2346171">Hastie and Tibshirani (1996)</a>
were indeed sparse. Using a simple two-dimensional simulated data set, we
demonstrate that the MDA classifier identifies three classes, each of which has
non-adjacent subclasses, whereas standard Gaussian assumption employed in linear
and quadratic discriminant analysis is clearly inadequate and produces poor
decision boundaries.</p></li>
